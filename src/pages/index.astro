        <strong>alice_d.ied</strong> is the pseudonym of Felix Thelen, a young, ambitious
        and talented artist living in Mannheim, Germany. His entire production is
        a confluence of emotions, experiences and his imaginative worlds of thought
        expressed in various art forms like paintings, plastics, NFTs, collagens,
        visuals. An intoxicated wonderland that displays a mirror of human beings
        their thoughts and how to be aware of. In his artworks he always envolves
        new dimensions of materiality and structures culminating in a sphere of fantasy
        and weirdness - inviting the recipient to dive deep into this dark but colorful
        universe of reflection, captured in multi-layered creations.
